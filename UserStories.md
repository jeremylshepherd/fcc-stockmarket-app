# Chart the Stock Market


### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

- [x] User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

- [x] User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.

- [x] User Story: I can remove stocks.

- [x] User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the **_"I've completed this challenge"_** button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
